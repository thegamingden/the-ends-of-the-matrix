<p><em>&quot;When the creations themselves can design creations better than we can
ourselves, they will likely do so if their motivations are anything akin to our
own. As the new generation takes form the rate of change of technology and the
world will become, if not infinite, at least faster than anything mankind has
previously experienced. Possibly faster than we are capable of even
understanding. That in essence is the singularity. All the mystical mumbo jumbo
amounts to little more than wishful thinking.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Sprites are the primary selling point of technomancers in Shadowrun, and
function very similarly to Spirits. Because they do have arbitrarily defined
limitations, they are not inherently world destroying as &quot;Agents&quot; were, so of
course we would want to include them in any overall Matrix overhaul.
Nonetheless, it is painfully clear that the writeup in the basic book is
incomprehensible gibberish and relatively little of it can be salvaged. I mean
hell, the &quot;Fault Sprite&quot; is supposed to be a combat monster, but it actually
can't fight at all because it is incapable of detecting icons in the matrix (and
thus cannot make attacks under any circumstances). That's dumb. So this is a
completely redone version of Sprites. The statlines and powers on pages 236 and
237 of the basic book are not salvageable in any fashion.</p>
<p>Sprites are almost never actually &quot;in&quot; a particular device, but instead float
around in free space as a ripple in the Resonance which surrounds Matrix
devices. Like technomancers, a sprite is considered to be connected to all
systems within range of themselves. A sprite can &quot;be&quot; anywhere, and can move its
location at the speed of light. But sprites suffer a reduction in rating if they
are in an area with limited wireless connectivity (such as a dead zone) or an
area with lots of interference (such as a jammed area). If a Sprite is ever
beyond its signal range to all Matrix devices, it is destroyed utterly.</p>
<p>Every sprite has the same Signal range as the technomancer who compiled it,
regardless of rating.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Rules:</strong> A Sprite can spend a Simple Action to join into the Network of
the Technomancer who compiled it (any Connections it has open transfer on to the
Technomancer). While so joined they cannot be individually attacked with any
normal matrix action (though they're still subject to Task Removal), and they
are simply crashed or not depending on the state of the Technomancer's Network
(as with a normal subsumed device). Joined Sprites even stay with the
Tehnomancer when they go Ghosting. Joined Sprites do <em>not</em> take their own
actions. Instead, one of them can take an Initiative Pass each round in place of
the Network's IC. If the Technomancer's Network is not currently running any IC
at all, one Sprite can take a single Initiative Pass immediately after the
Technomancer's first Initiative Pass in a combat round. While joined, a Sprite
maintains its own ability scores for determining any dice pools it rolls on
actions it performs, and joined Sprites <em>don't</em> grant any of their ability
scores to their Technomancer's Network (Though the Puppeteer power can kinda do
that, if that's what you want). A Technomancer can eject a Sprite from their
Network as a Matrix Free Action.</p>
<a class="header" href="#types-of-sprites" id="types-of-sprites"><h2>Types of Sprites</h2></a>
<p><em>&quot;I've heard your song. It's a bad song.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are now ten categories of Sprites, and each technomancer has a personal
stream which can compile just five of them. Like magical traditions, each
individual interpretation of the Deep Resonance assigns one type of sprite to
each category of programming. Registered Sprites can assist a technomancer in
learning or sustaining Complex Forms of the type that the Sprite is linked to. A
Sprite does not need to have the skill that's normally associated with a Complex
Form category to affect that category (eg: an Archive sprite doesn't have
Cybercombat, but a Stream can still associate Archive sprites with Attack
Complex Forms).</p>

<p>The Sprite may grant its rating in bonus dice to soak Icon damage to a number of
icons up to the Sprite's System. If more than one Sprite is providing Antivirus
to the same device or network, use the teamwork rules.</p>
<a class="header" href="#chain-letter" id="chain-letter"><h4>Chain Letter</h4></a>
<p>The Sprite opens a Connection with the target which then begins attempting to
open up connections with other networks and devices. The Sprite makes a Charisma
+ System check opposed by the target's Firewall + Willpower + Signal Defense (if
any). Every net hit represents a combat turn in which any node can open a
connection with the target with a Matrix Free Action.</p>
<a class="header" href="#clarity" id="clarity"><h4>Clarity</h4></a>
<p>The Sprite's mere presence causes the Resonance to be audible as a low hum even
to non-technomancers. Any static zones within the sprite's Signal range are
reduced in rating by half the Sprite's rating. This is determined before the
Background has a chance to reduce the Sprite's rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#data-masking" id="data-masking"><h4>Data Masking</h4></a>
<p>The Sprite can appear to be any kind of Icon it chooses. This includes
background iconography, allowing the sprite to become effectively invisible.
Only those who get a number of hits on a Matrix Perception test equal to the
hits it gets on a Response + Intuition test can perceive it for what it is – or
at all if it doesn't want to be seen. Without Data Masking, a sprite cannot
Spoof itself (not having an Access ID), and this ability substitutes for the
Spoof action.</p>
<a class="header" href="#desu" id="desu"><h4>Desu</h4></a>
<p>Desu desu desu desu desu, desu desu. Desu desu desu. Desu desu desu:
Desu. Desu desu desu desu desu desu. Desu; Desu; Desu. Desu desu desu.</p>
<p>The Sprite can insinuate a meme into the mind of a target within signal range
and LOS. This uses Charisma + System and bypasses normal spam filters, being
resisted with Willpower alone. Net hits indicate the veracity of the meme.</p>
<a class="header" href="#filter" id="filter"><h4>Filter</h4></a>
<p>The Sprite's presence actively removes clutter from the Resonance. Any spam
zones within the sprite's Signal range are reduced in rating by half the
Sprite's rating. This is determined before the Background has a chance to reduce
the Sprite's rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#find" id="find"><h4>Find</h4></a>
<p>The Sprites claim that information in data stores throughout the Matrix all feed
into the Deep Resonance, that they can in some way be accessed regardless of
whether Matrix topology allows a connection in the traditional sense. This is
indicated quite clearly with the Find power – which allows a Sprite to make an
Intuition + System test to say where a fact or file is actually located.
Actually getting to that place may be difficult, but the first step in any
journey is discovering where you are going. More encrypted data has a higher
threshold to Find.</p>
<a class="header" href="#gremlins" id="gremlins"><h4>Gremlins</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite with the Gremlins ability can make a device fail. The Sprite rolls
twice its rating, if the target device is not part of a network, it simply rolls
its Firewall to resist. If the device is part of a network, the resistance is
made with Firewall + Intuition. If the sprite gets any net hits, the device
fails as if a glitch had occurred. If the sprite achieves extraordinary success,
the device fails catastrophically, as if a critical glitch had occurred.</p>
<a class="header" href="#innate-form" id="innate-form"><h4>Innate Form</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite with the Innate Form power gains knowledge of one complex form that the
compiling technomancer knows. If the Innate Form power is followed by one or
more categories in parentheses, the Complex Form must be chosen from one of
those categories.</p>
<a class="header" href="#merge" id="merge"><h4>Merge</h4></a>
<p>Normally speaking, a sprite is not &quot;in&quot; a device, but a Sprite with the Merge
power can do so. The sprite simply finds an orphan device and joins with it. The
device behaves as if the sprite were networked with it. The sprite then can only
interact with the Matrix through the device's own wireless or wired
capabilities, but so long as the sprite is merged with a device it is not
affected by Background as a sprite normally would be. In this way a sprite can
crawl into a drone and drive off into a dead zone without winking out of
existence.</p>
<a class="header" href="#message" id="message"><h4>Message</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite with Message can instantly send information to any Matrix address,
regardless of real location. This message is low information density, and can
thus only contain words, pictures, and instructions – not meaningful executable
code. This email travels through the resonance realms and arrives
instantaneously and cannot be intercepted. Both the Sprite and the target must
be connected to the Matrix, but there need not be a literal or knowable
connection available between the target and the Sprite. Even the speed of light
is not a factor as the message does not actually travel through intervening
space in any meaningful sense.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pop-ups" id="pop-ups"><h4>Pop Ups</h4></a>
<p>The data-trail of some sprites is dangerously unstable and full of malicious
code fragments. When such a sprite succeeds in using any Connection range form
against another icon, that icon must resist the sprite's rating in Icon damage
in addition to whatever effects the action would normally have. Furthermore, if
another icon successfully connects with a Connection or Handshake ranged program
or form against the sprite, that icon must resist the sprite's rating in Icon
damage as destabilizing code rushes up the connection automatically.</p>
<a class="header" href="#signal-management" id="signal-management"><h4>Signal Management</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite with Signal Management provides Signal Defense even though it is a
Sprite.</p>
<a class="header" href="#spam" id="spam"><h4>Spam</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite with Spam can fill up data stores with unwanted and useless information
and queries. The veracity of all information in the target data stores is
reduced by the sprite's rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stability" id="stability"><h4>Stability</h4></a>
<p>A device protected by Stability does not suffer mishaps. Glitches are ignored
and Critical Glitches are treated as the regular kind while operating the
targeted device.</p>
<a class="header" href="#tesla-burst" id="tesla-burst"><h4>Tesla Burst</h4></a>
<p>The sprite causes a discordant burst of electrical activity throughout the area
of its Signal range. Any devices with a Signal less than the sprite's rating
have their wireless projecting abilities burnt out . Devices with a device
rating lower than the sprite's Signal become permanently nonfunctional.
Hardening adds to the device's rating to determine whether it survives.</p>
<a class="header" href="#great-form-sprite-powers" id="great-form-sprite-powers"><h2>Great Form Sprite Powers</h2></a>
<p><em>&quot;There are more things in the Matrix than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When a Sprite is upgraded to Great Form, it may acquire a special power. The
powers are very impressive, and using any one of them is a Task. Others exist,
but here are some examples that may resonate with a particular stream. The great
form sprites of any stream all have access to just a single great form power.</p>
<a class="header" href="#akashic-recording" id="akashic-recording"><h4>Akashic Recording</h4></a>
<p>With the expenditure of a Task, the spirit simply creates Truth® on the Matrix.
A fact, identity, or story resonates through the Matrix until it has <em>always
been there</em>. This newly ancient wisdom has an apparent Veracity equal to the
Sprite's Rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#puppeteer" id="puppeteer"><h4>Puppeteer</h4></a>
<p>With the expenditure of a Task, the sprite extends itself into a metahuman's
brain, transforming the body into an extension of the sprite's network. The
Sprite rolls double its rating, resisted by Willpower + Firewall + Signal
Defense (if any). If the Sprite succeeds, the victim becomes a node that the
sprite runs on. The newly combined entity uses the physical attributes of the
victim increased by the Rating of the Sprite, and the Sprite's Metal attributes.
A sprite using Puppeteer is unaffected by harmful Backgrounds.</p>
<a class="header" href="#system-failure" id="system-failure"><h4>System Failure</h4></a>
<p>With the expenditure of a Task, the Matrix collapses for kilometers around. The
Sprite retreats into a Resonance Realm and like a drain in the sink the Matrix
itself spirals out of the world with it. The Sprite rolls double its rating, and
all servers, networks, and devices within the sprite's Rating in kilometers
which fail to equal that number of hits on a Firewall + Willpower + Signal
Defense test have all their connections terminated and all their data stores
erased.</p>
<p>Cyberware actually has failsafes for this sort of thing, and in most cases
firmware takes over seamlessly. When a cybereye's data stores go down the
character's saved videos are all gone and the appearance on the eyes will revert
to factory defaults – but the character is unlikely to lose the ability to see.
It is not recommended to roll separately for the resistance of every single
network in a major city - simply assume that the number of data stores brought
down is proportional to the number of hits the sprite achieves, and actually
roll dice for the story important data stores like the PANs of player
characters.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unmake" id="unmake"><h4>Unmake</h4></a>
<p>With the expenditure of a Task, all traces of a piece of information vanish from
the Matrix without a trace. It is as if a person had never existed at all. Every
footnote, every link, every corroborating piece of documentation simply cannot
be found. A sprite cannot remove knowledge with a Veracity higher than its
Rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#wealth" id="wealth"><h4>Wealth</h4></a>
<p>With the expenditure of a Task, bank accounts increase, catalog orders are made
and paid for, and invoices are lost. Over the course of the next week the
target's real wealth is increased by 10,000¥ per hit on a System + Charisma
test. A single character cannot benefit from Wealth more than once per month.
Subsequent uses within a month only result in the gaining of more money if they
result in more hits.</p>
<a class="header" href="#tasks" id="tasks"><h2>Tasks</h2></a>
<p><em>&quot;Now what would you pay?!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest and most impressive power of the Technomancer is their
ability to call upon their Sprites. A Technomancer may only have one
Unregistered Sprite at a time. They may have up to their Charisma in Registered
Sprites, and Sprites count against their limit whether they are camping in a
Resonance Realm or not (and can be pulled back and forth as a Simple Action).
Unregistered sprites serve until their tasks are complete or their eight hours
are up, at which point they de-rez and vanish.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-tasks" id="basic-tasks"><h3>Basic Tasks</h3></a>
<p>An Unregistered Sprite may only perform basic tasks. They can use their powers
or forms, they can go tell people things, they can move data around, and those
of them as have the ability to do so can perform physical services through
control of robots. Unregistered Sprites can only communicate with the
technomancer who compiled them while they are within Signal range.</p>
<p>In general, a Task is whatever you can describe as a discreet action. For
example &quot;Use Armor on my team.&quot; is a task, and &quot;Hack that door open&quot; is a task.
Free Sprites can provide the benefits of basic tasks, but they are normally
under no compulsion to do so.</p>
<a class="header" href="#registered-tasks" id="registered-tasks"><h3>Registered Tasks</h3></a>
<p>A Registered Sprite can continue to communicate with its technomancer
<em>regardless of distance</em>. In addition, there are a number of specialized tasks
that a Registered Sprite can perform (each time it uses any of these abilities
it uses up a task). These tasks can only be performed by a registered sprite at
the cost of a Task:</p>
<a class="header" href="#aid-form" id="aid-form"><h4>Aid Form</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite can provide a bonus to a technomancer's dicepool when activating a
Complex Form in the Sprite's category equal to the Sprite's Rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#aid-study" id="aid-study"><h4>Aid Study</h4></a>
<p>A Sprite can be called upon to teach a technomancer Complex Forms within their
discipline. Not only does the Complex Form become learnable, but the
technomancer gains a dicepool bonus on learning the Form equal to the sprite's
Rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#great-form-power" id="great-form-power"><h4>Great Form Power</h4></a>
<p>A Registered Sprite that has a Great Form Power may use it at the cost of one
task.</p>
<a class="header" href="#loaned-task" id="loaned-task"><h4>Loaned Task</h4></a>
<p>A Registered Sprite can have its tasks owed assigned to other users, who may
thence benefit from the sprite's abilities directly.</p>
<a class="header" href="#sustain-form" id="sustain-form"><h4>Sustain Form</h4></a>
<p>A sprite can sustain a Complex Form in its category for a number of hours equal
to its rating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#resonance-natives-free-sprites-ghosts-and-ais" id="resonance-natives-free-sprites-ghosts-and-ais"><h2>Resonance Natives: Free Sprites, Ghosts, and AIs</h2></a>
<p><em>&quot;If you prick me, do I not bleak?&quot;</em></p>
<p>The origins of a Free Sprite and a Roaming Artificial Intelligence are very
different, but game mechanically they are treated exactly the same. A Free
Sprite is a sprite which for whatever reason failed to derez when its connection
to its compiling technomancer was cut. A Roaming AI is an artificial
intelligence which for whatever reason has been able to escape the hardware
which originally contained it. Sprites usually need a <em>reason</em> to do that sort
of thing, and it usually only happens to Registered Sprites who have been around
for a long time. Noone really knows how a Artificial Intelligence might be able
to escape its hardware, because the semi-organic matrices that they are created
on are as necessary to their existence as a human's brain is to their existence.
But of course there is a confirmed and equally unexplained phenomenon of actual
metahumans whose body dies while they are online leaving them as a &quot;ghost in the
machine.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether it is originally a series of Turing Testing programming running on a
scaffold of dissected rat brains and circuits, a human who died during a
marathon game of Miracle Shooter, or a Sprite who felt its mission was
incomplete, all of these are treated the same in game terms. They are simply
treated as a Sprite of some kind with a rating and optional powers as normal.
However, they differ from normal sprites in that they are hard to decompile
(they are considered to have a number of tasks ahead of them equal to their
Willpower that refresh every minute), and they advance themselves.</p>
<p>Matrix Natives have seemingly incomprehensible goals, and when they achieve
them, their code strengthens. In game terms this just means that they adventure
and get Build Points and Karma as normal.</p>
<a class="header" href="#powers-of-the-matrix-natives" id="powers-of-the-matrix-natives"><h3>Powers of the Matrix Natives</h3></a>
<p>As Matrix Natives become more powerful they gain additional powers, most of
which are drawn from their own optional power list. Every time they Submerge
they choose an extra optional power, or get one of the special optional powers
below:</p>
<a class="header" href="#credit-rating" id="credit-rating"><h4>Credit Rating</h4></a>
<p>Some Matrix Natives are able to draw upon funds every month as if the Resonance
itself were giving them an allowance. These beings get 5000¥ a month per point
of Resonance attribute to play with as they see fit.</p>
<a class="header" href="#deep-resonance-gateway" id="deep-resonance-gateway"><h4>Deep Resonance Gateway</h4></a>
<p>A Matrix Native with the Deep Resonance Gateway power can draw users already in
VR into a Resonance Realm.</p>
<a class="header" href="#resonance-gateway" id="resonance-gateway"><h4>Resonance Gateway</h4></a>
<p>Some Matrix Natives can force open all possible connections within a burst of
their Resonance in Meters. By succeeding at a Resonance + Computer test resisted
by Willpower + Firewall + Cybercombat they can force any or all users into full
VR.</p>
