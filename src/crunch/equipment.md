## Hacking Hardware

#### Trodes

A trode net has a signal of -1, and can only make contact with a brain which is within a few centimeters. Also in the case of any serious Static, a trode net will be disrupted completely, potentially cutting the person off from their network.

#### Nanopaste Trodes

Nanopaste has a signal of only -2, but when in contact with skin it burrows in, making a connection that is again disrupted when subjected to any severe static.

#### Commlinks

Commlinks come in a wide array of models custom and standard. It would be hilariously pointless for us to pretend that there are some finite number of possibilities for Commlink types that Shadowrunners might use. For convenience, despite the fact that the actual price point of commlinks varies tremendously based on market conditions and perceived brand reliability and such, we assume that a *better* Commlink will *cost more*. Any particular commlink will have a Response and a Signal. The cost in ¥ will be the price of the Response and the Signal added together, while the availability will simply be the higher of the two.

### Signal Ranges

#### Commlink Names

Just because you're using a SONY Emperor doesn't mean that you're using the Fall '71 Emperor *sunlight* with a dual-quad optical recoder. Indeed, the basic model name of a commlink basically tells you close to nothing about what the commlink's actual capabilities are. So commlink names are basically NERPS. Here is a list of prominent commlink families put out by your favorite companies:

* **Chantico Home Appliances:** Buena; Maize; Jaguar; Quetzal
* **CMT:** Clip; Hammer; Rod
* **Erika:** Elite; Prima; ! (this one is hard to pronounce)
* **Fairlight:** Caliban; Gilgamesh
* **Hermes:** Ikon; Magister; Tornado
* **MCT:** Bureaucrat; Hub; Meta Link; Sage
* **Novatech:** Airwave; Mastermind; Pocket Secretary
* **Sony:** Assistant; Comman; Emperor
* **Transys:** Avalon; Luna; Oz

#### Credsticks

A Certified Credstick costs just 25¥ and represents a connection to a bank account which is not tied to any particular SIN but to a passcode (which can be changed by anyone with the current passcode). It is for this reason that Credsticks are often used as cash by criminal types. The effective dedicated firewall of a certified Credstick is 5. Various banks issue credsticks to members which are tied to SINs, and these generally have dedicated firewalls of 6 to 8.

#### Retransmitters

A retransmitter is a device which has a high density signal output. So long as it is part of a character's network, signal range can be traced from the retransmiter (though LOS cannot). A Retransmitter weighs about a kilogram, has a signal of 3, and costs 25¥. More powerful retransmitters are available. You can get a signal of 4 for 125¥, or a signal of 5 for 250¥.

#### Microtransmitters

A microtransmitter is a retransmitter which is small enough to fit into things. They cost twice as much as regular retransmitters and have an availability of 6.

#### Directional Retransmitters

Just because you can have a secondary device send your data off, doesn't mean that it can be used to draw LOS. A directional retransmitter is like a Retransmitter in size. It costs three times as much as a Retransmitter and has an availability of 6.

#### Sat Links

Satellites circle the globe in staggering number. Most communication with LEO satellites is done with low density signal. These transmitters usually have a signal of 6 and may actually be incapable of being used to send high density signal. There are three kinds of portable satellite link-ups. One is a dish which is itself non portable. One is portable but only with effort as it weighs in at four to six kilograms. And the last is a module which can be plugged into a commlink with ease (weighing 300-500 grams). In any case, sat links which are capable of actually projecting a Signal rating of 8 are substantially more expensive. Sat Links are also rating 1 Receivers. Most Satellites themselves have Signal 10.

| Sat Link |     Cost |     Availability |
|:---------|---------:|:----------------:|
| Fixed (6)    | 250¥ |    Always|
| Portable (6) | 500¥ |    4|
| Module (6)   | 2,000¥ |   6|
| Fixed (8)    | 20,000¥ |  10|
| Portable (8) | 50,000¥  | 12|
| Module (8)   | 150,000¥  |20|

#### Receivers

The signal range is the range at which a system can project high density signal to affect a device which is not otherwise receptive to the signals. It is coincidentally the range at which large amounts of high density signal can be sent through an open connection to a device with a rating 0 receiver. These rating 0 receivers are cheap and plentiful, and every commlink is assumed to have one. More powerful receivers exist, but have constraints as to size. Game mechanically, they add their ratings to the signal of *other devices* to determine range *to the receiver*. Satellites usually have a Rating 3 receiver on board, which allows a Signal of 8 to send high density signal to LEO satellites and low density signal to Geosynchronous satellites despite their very high altitude.

| Receiver |     Cost |     Availability |
|:---------|---------:|:----------------:|
| Fixed (1)   | 100¥  |   Always |
| Portable (1) | 200¥ |    4 |
| Module (1)  | 600¥  |   6 |
| Fixed (2)   | 14,000¥ |  10 |
| Portable (2) | 20,000¥ |  12 |
| Fixed (3)   | 100,000¥ | 15 |
| Fixed (4)   | 1,500,000¥ | 24 |

## Hacking Software

#### Operating Systems

Jokes aside, Windows ME is not *exactly* the same as Windows Vista, and there are a bewildering number of alternatives for the consumer of Operating Systems in 2071. Like commlinks, it is assumed that characters will be savvy shoppers and purchase the more expensive versions of Operating Systems which are *better* rather than the ones which are merely slight NERPS modifications on existing technology.

An Operating System affects an entire network, but it still is designed to be run on a specific network hub. Transferring an OS to a different commlink is doable, but degrades performance (reduce ratings of System and Firewall by 2 until someone makes a Logic + Software (12, 8 hours) test to reoptimize it for the new system).

| Rating | System   | Firewall | Availability |
|:------:|---------:|---------:|:------------:|
| 1     | 50¥      | 20¥     | Always |
| 2     | 300¥     | 50¥     | Always |
| 3     | 700¥     | 100¥    | Always |
| 4     | 2,000¥    | 500¥    | Always |
| 5     | 5,000¥    | 1,000¥   | 4 |
| 6     | 14,000¥   | 3,000¥   | 8 |
| 7     | 48,000¥   | 8,000¥   | 16 |
| 8     | 175,000¥  | 200,000¥ | 32 |
| 9     | 750,000¥  | 1,200,000¥   | 36 |

#### Operating Systems for Dedicated Systems

Most dedicated systems have a System of 1. This is because they don't ever need to be utilized in orchestrating spare processor cycles on other devices. If a genuine network is used, the device's OS will fade to the background. In general one can expect decent dedicated firewalls on most high grade devices. A Device should be expected to have a dedicated firewall equal to its device rating.

#### Other Programs

| Rated Programs | Cost | Availability |
|:---------------|-----:|:------------:|
| Analysis Programs | 500¥/R | 2/R |
| Attack Programs | 2,000¥/R | 2/R |
| Communications Programs | 1,000¥/R | 2/R |
| Exploit Programs | 1,500¥/R | 2/R |
| Operations Programs | 500¥/R | 2/R |
| Pilot | 500¥/R | 3/R* |
| IC | 500¥/R | 2/R |
| Pilot Accessory | 100¥/R | 4/R* |

(*): Pilot and Pilot Accessory programming (Clearsight, Targeting, Maneuver, etc.) are purchased for individual devices. Pilot Accessory programming is capped in rating by the Pilot rating, Pilot is uncapped. These programs cannot be optimized for other systems.

Most Program ratings are capped by the system of the network they are running on. IC is an exception and is instead limited by the Firewall of the Network or Device it is running on. Programs set up for one OS work very poorly (-2 to rating and dicepools) when used on another OS until someone reoptimizes it for the new system with a Logic + Software check (10-System Rating, 2 hours).

Dedicated programming generally costs half as much.

The Rating of a program caps the number of hits (not net hits) that can be scored with a program.

## Matrix Interference Technology

Sometimes you don't even want to hack or browse the latest news feeds, you just want to shut the Matrix down and move on with your life.

#### WiFi Blocking Paint

A marvel of modern technology, WiFi blocking paint reduces the strength of signal going through it by its Rating. If the modified signal is not sufficient to cross the actual distance, then signal range is not attainable. This is not a form of jamming and cannot be circumvented with ECCM. A can of WiFi blocking paint is nearly 4 liters and covers an area of 30 square meters. It costs 20¥ per rating per can, and is available in ratings up to 6.

#### Faraday Cage

A basic fact of physics, a topologically complete covering of high conductivity redirects the vast majority of incoming radiation, effectively locking all but the most powerful signals. A Faraday Cage reduces the effective signal across it by 4 times its rating, and is available in ratings of 1-4. Faraday Cages are purchased in square meter surface units. Flat squares cost only 5¥ per meter, and the flexible meshes cost 20¥ per meter. The *transparent* units for use in windows cost ten times as much. A Faraday Cage ceases to function if the topology is opened. So for example: if you made a car into a Rating 2 Faraday Cage it would block out all signals of rating 8 or less, but only so long as all the doors and windows were closed. A typical car can be fitted with a Faraday Cage in 16 square meters, 6 of which are transparent.

#### Faraday Suit

A Faraday Suit is a full body covering flexible mesh that modifies an existing full body armor (that must include a helmet). It costs 500¥ per rating point.

#### Head Jammer

The Head Jammer or "Faraday Hat" actually functions by canceling incoming signals rather than diverting them, so the term "Faraday Hat" is actually not physically accurate. A Head Jammer reduces the signal rating of transmissions going into or out of the head. Setting one up takes just a complex action, and its rating can be temporarily increased (up to double its current rating) with a complex action (rolling Logic + Electronic Warfare and increasing effective rating by hits). ECCM is effective against this. Cost is 250¥ per rating point and availability is 6R.

## Rigging Equipment

### Sensor Packages

Sensors in 2071 can meet or exceed the capabilities of the human sensory abilities. And they can do so with objects which are even smaller than the sense organs of a human body, but it costs a fair amount of money to get equipment that can do that. Size categories are in reference to the size of the object they are supposed to fit into. A microdrone is small enough to fit into a wallet, so sensor packages that are small enough to fit into them are very expensive. A minidrone is small enough to fit into a palm or a human eye socket. A small drone is roughly the size of a human head, and its sensor packages cost precisely as much as putting sensors into real metahuman head (you can use cyberware prices). A medium drone is about the size of a dog. A large drone is the size of a human. A huge drone is about the size of a car. A titanic drone is the size of garbage truck or larger. The base availabilities and costs are those of cybernetic senses from SR4 and Augmentation. Note that the senses available as cyberware take sensory information in at full simsense levels, and that mere 20th century cameras are much cheaper. Drones *can* get multiple sets of single sense types and toggle between them.

| Size     | Cost     | Availability |
|:---------|:--------:|:------------:|
| Micro    | x10¥     |  +4 |
| Mini     | x2¥      |  +2 |
| Small    | x1¥ | +0 |
| Medium   | 1/2¥  |    +0 |
| Large    | 1/2¥   |   +2 |
| Huge     | 1/4¥  | +0 |
| Titanic  | 1/10¥  |    +4 |

#### Example: Outfitting a Doberman

Glitch wants her attack drone to see as well as she does, which means that it should be capable of seeing at a metahuman level in both normal and infrared spectra. The doberman itself only costs 3,000¥. The thermographic vision and smartlink that she wants will take up only 3 capacity and thus will fit in a Rating 1 eye system. The total package would cost 2,500¥ in a metahuman skull, but in this case it's built for a drone that has a lot less squishy bits. Sensor packages for a medium drone cost half human cyberware price, so the sensor package is just 1,250¥. Together with the drone, Glitch is out 4,250¥ and has a drone that can send her visual inputs just as good as her own.

#### Reduced Vision

The basic 500¥ vision package assumes that you are getting human-level simsense quality vision, which is actually pretty good. You can purchase vision packages which are less good in a number of ways for less money. You can get a non-realtime still camera for ¼ price (this can nonetheless get normal vision enhancements, though things like smartlinks are fairly useless on such a device). You can get a low quality video feed for a base of 100¥, you can get a grainy low quality video feed for a base 40¥.

#### Reduced Hearing

The basic 500¥ hearing package assumes that you are getting fully functional human level hearing - like a metahuman's. If you don't need full simsense, you can get a low fidelity audio feed for 50¥, and a low fidelity audio feed with some heinous distortion for about 10¥.

#### Minimal Pressure Sensors

The basic 1000¥ touch package assumes a human level of proprioception and tactile sensation. If you don't need full smsense tactile ability out of a drone, you can get much lesser packages. A basic motion sensor costs only 50¥, and a basic orientation unit costs 100¥. 

#### Sensor Systems

New Sensor handling hardware can be installed on a drone, increasing its sensor rating. Cost is 500¥ per rating, with an availability of 4x rating.

#### BattleTac System

The surveillance state isn't just the United Kingdom anymore, now it's everywhere. But actually viewing all of those cameras is essentially impossible for anyone. However, data mining large numbers of sensory recordings for positional information to derive tactical advantages is well within the capabilities of extremely powerful computers. The BattleTac system is a set of hardware that extracts tactical information from multiple sensory feeds. So long as multiple viewpoints are available, the system can assist the combat abilities of all users in the system. In order to contribute to the system, a user needs to send it high density simsense feed, but benefiting from the BattleTac's conclusions requires only a display link. In game terms, the effective rating of the system cancels out penalties for being attacked multiple times and cover provided by allies in the system. The BattleTac's rating limits the amount of such penalty it can cancel, and the unit's effective rating is capped by how many viewpoints are contributing to it. A user operating in Hot Sim operates as if the BattleTac's rating were one higher.

| Rating |   Minimum Units |  Cost |      Availability |
|:------:|:---------------:|------:|:-----------------:|
| 1  |      2     |         15,000¥  |  8F |
| 2  |      4     |         30,000¥   | 12F |
| 3  |      8     |         90,000¥   | 16F |
| 4 |        16    |         160,000¥ |  24F |

#### Step By Step: Using a Tactical Computer

Chun the Unavoidable has a Rating 2 BattleTac system and 2 drones with him. He is currently running his display link in BTL because that's how he rolls. He has his own SimRig and one of his two drones is providing SimSense quality feed, while the other is not. This means that he has 2 contributing members on the BattleTac and thus the system is capped at Rating 1. So both of his drones will not lose a defense die the first time someone attacks them. However, Chun himself is running in Hot Sim, so he is getting it at an effective rating of 2, canceling the first and second multiple attacker penalties to his defense pools.

### Pilot Systems

#### Rigger Adaptation

A device which has a pilot rating can have a new pilot software installed that makes it more awesome for the cost of the better software. A device that does *not* have a pilot in the first place has to be adapted to remote operations. A Rigger Adaptation gives a device a Pilot of 1, and costs 500¥ per size of the new drone (Micro: 500¥, Mini 1,000¥, Small 1,500¥, Medium 2,000¥, Large 2,500¥, Huge 3,000¥). And yes, in many cases it is flat cheaper to buy a modern device that already has a pilot in it and upgrade from there.


## Cyberware

#### Retinal Duplication

Sorry, the one on page 333 is extremely expensive and don't actually work. The proper cost should be 15,000¥ with an availability of 12F, and no rating at all. The device displays a simsense quality Retina, once you've gotten a copy from somewhere an electronic device *cannot* tell the difference. If you are programming it in with a less than perfect knowledge of the retina you are copying, then your copy is only as good as your information. In general, one can make a Logic + Computer test to attempt to fool scanners if you have nothing but an image of the appropriate retina from an archive.

#### Internal Commlinks

Internal Commlinks are of primary use because of the direct wired connection they have to the user's brain. This allows the user to wirelessly communicate with their network through EUE and severely limit the ability of hackers to take their network away. The system is set to send information in and out, and bypasses a need to have a Sim Module. The Internal Commlink costs .2 Essence and 2,000¥ plus the cost of the commlink itself. If you get it at a higher grade, you only need to pay the extra cost for the 2,000¥ installation feed, not the cost including the commlink itself. When installed, the Commlink can either be Hot Sim enabled or not. Enabling BTL is illegal in many places, but not doing so will not necessarily prevent you from using it. However, if a wired BTL path is not established when the device is installed, Hot Sim sensory information will have to be sent wirelessly, at which point the Internal Commlink will act just like a set of trodes while the network is running hot. Hot Sim enabling uses up no more Essence and doesn't cost a different amount, it literally just changes the legality.

#### Internal SimRig

An Internal SimRig is a direct attachment to the sensory and emotive portions of the neurophysiology of the user. This not only gives the user the best possible sensory bonus to Matrix Perception, but also allows the user to send full simsense feed out. But perhaps the sneakiest part of all is that the hardware itself is legal and can be manipulated in *software* to produce BTL sequences. This means that it can be used for Hot Sim (by routing sensory data through those emotive and interpretive tracks) without actually showing up as illegal hardware on a medical scan of any invasiveness. This makes it the number one piece of hacker hardware. It costs .5 Essence and 5,000¥.

#### Internal Sim Module

This device translates external data feeds into sensory feeds, and it does so inside the body after it's too late for snoopers to intercept the transmission. This may seem like a small subset of what an internal commlink can do and it is. It's basically the "input" section of the input/output of an internal commlink. It costs 1,000¥ and .1 Essence, and can be set up for Hot Sim making it illegal.
